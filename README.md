# TIC-TAC-TOE

A Serverless Web Game with Authentication and Score Tracking.

A fully serverless web-based game where users must sign in to play. Their scores are tracked and stored using AWS services. The project includes frontend and backend pipelines, along with infrastructure-as-code (IaC) to provision all necessary resources.
