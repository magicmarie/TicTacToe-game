# TIC-TAC-TOE

A Serverless Web Game with Authentication and Score Tracking.

A fully serverless web-based game where users must sign in to play. Their scores are tracked and stored using AWS services. The project includes frontend and backend pipelines, along with infrastructure-as-code (IaC) to provision all necessary resources.

#### Frontend
- Framework: **ReactJS**
- Hosted on **Amazon S3** with **CloudFront** CDN.

#### Backend
- Language: Node.js
- **AWS Lambda** functions for game logic and APIs.

- Templates define:
  - S3 buckets
  - Lambda functions
  - API Gateway
  - Cognito user pool and identity pool
  - DynamoDB table
  - IAM roles and policies
  - CloudFront distribution
